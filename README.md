py-scp
======

Do you use SCP a lot? Is your development environment layout different to wherever you usually SCP files to? Then PySCP is the script for you!

**This repo is under development so anything below this line may change when the final script is released**

Getting Started
-----------------
To get started using PySCP, you will need to create the folder mapping. To do this, run `pyscp --init`. This will create a directory in your home folder called `.pyscp` that contains the main configuration file `config.json`. Simply edit it to your needs. For example:

	{
		"directory-mapping":{
			"all":{
				// Any default mapping rules go here
			},
			"123.4.5.6":{
				"/path/to/local/directory":"/path/to/remote/directory"
			}
		}
	}

Then simply run pyscp in a similar way to how you would use the default `scp` command.  and run using `pyscp /path/to/local/directory/file.txt user@123.4.5.6`. This will scp `file.txt` to `/path/to/remote/directory` on the remote server (in this case: 123.4.5.6.)

If you wish to upload `file.txt` under a different name, you can do so by adding an extra argument to the end of the previous command. If you wanted `file.txt` to be renamed to `file_remote.txt` for example, you can use: `pyscp /path/to/local/directory/file.txt user@123.4.5.6 file_remote.txt`

Voila!
